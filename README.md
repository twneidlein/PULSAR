# PULSAR

PUmped Liquid System for Student and Amateur Rocketry, PULSAR is a team at Purdue University designing, building, and testing a cryogenically compatible electronic feed system for small rockets.

## Description

Our first project, the PikaPump, is a test pump sized from Purdue Space Program Liquid's Crater Maker Special rocket.  It contains all the documentation, CAD files, mechanical drawings, DAQ and motor controller code, ANSYS CFD files, and CFturbo files. It should be noted that the novel magnetic coupler device the team tested was unable to hit our rpm target, so the pump did not meet the pressure rise and flowrate requirements; however, hopefully this repository can help others by reducing the amount of research and setup required. Feel free to use any information below for non-commercial projects, including hobbiest and educational ones.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Must have CFturbo to run .cft files.
* To access CFD files, download 7zip 
* Must have ANSYS Workbench, CFX, and CFDPost to view the CFD. 

### Installing

* Download the files as a zip file, then unzip them.
* The CAD is available in OnShape: https://cad.onshape.com/documents/3ee609e6bb3bc94de198d5cf/w/ba28e37b976e589be2fad60c/e/f99038d5f3ab1b5ac4c240aa 
* To open the CFD files, select all six of them in the 7zip application, and then unzip them. They will become one ANSYS folder, with which you can view the CFD.
