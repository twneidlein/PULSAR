PUmped Liquid System for Student and Amateur Rocketry, PULSAR is a team at Purdue University designing, building, and testing a cryogenically compatible electronic feed system for small rockets. Our first project, the PikaPump, is a test pump sized from Purdue Space Program Liquid's Crater Maker Special rocket. Good luck on your own projects!
